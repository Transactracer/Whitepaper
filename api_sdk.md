APIs and SDKs play an essential role in the modern software ecosystem. APIs are sets of rules and protocols that determine how different software applications interact with each other, allowing them to share data and functionality seamlessly. On the other hand, SDKs are collections of software resources, including libraries, tools, documentation, and code samples, which allow developers to create applications that interact with a specific platform or software.
