1. **Transaction Fees:** Users can utilize $Trans tokens or Stable coins to pay for transaction fees within the platform. 

2. **Subscription Payments:** Users can use $Trans tokens to pay for their monthly or yearly subscriptions or they can pay using Stable coins. There would be discount for those who use $Trans tokens.

3. **Access to Premium Features:** Certain premium features or services within Transactracer could be exclusively accessible by spending $Trans tokens. This includes advanced AI analytics, Automating invoices and getting AI generated Tax reports.

4. **Staking:** Users could stake $Trans tokens in return for rewards. Staking could help secure the platform, participate in consensus mechanisms if applicable, and earn rewards for token holders.

5. **API Access:** To access Transactracer's  API access for third-party integration, $Trans tokens needed to be used as the means of payment for accessing these services.

6. **Inter-chain Transaction Discounts:** Given Transactracer's multi-chain capabilities, we will provide discounts on transactions that span multiple blockchains (inter-chain transactions) when paid with $Trans tokens.

7. **Automated Tax Services:** For users needing extra help with tax planning and compliance, $Trans tokens would be used to access an automated tax filing service integrated into the platform.

8. **Token Burn Program:** To maintain the value of the token and avoid inflation, a portion of the tokens collected through the platform's various services would be periodically burned (permanently removed from circulation).
